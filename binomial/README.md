## Overview

`"binomial"` is an R package that implements functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

- `bin_choose()` calculates the number of combinations in which k successes can occur in n trials
- `bin_probability()` calculates the probability of a number of successes in some trials
- `bin_distribution()` creates data frame with the probabilities of successes within a number of trials
- `plot()` a method to barplot the object generated by `bin_distribution()`, or a line plot for the object created using `bin_cumulative()`
- `bin_cumulative()` creates a data frame showing successes, their probabilities, and cumulative probabilities
- `bin_variable()` lists the number of trials, probability, and attribute of the object
- `summary()` lists the summary measures (i.e. mean, variance, etc.) of a binomial variable from `bin_variable()`
- `bin_mean()` calculates expected value or mean of a binomial distribution
- `bin_variance()` calculates variance of a binomial distribution
- `bin_mode()` calculates mode of a binomial distribution
- `bin_skewness()` calculates the skewness of a binomial distribution
- `bin_kurtosis()` calculates tailedness of a binomial distribution; kurtosis formula

## Motivation

This package has been developed to illustrate some of the concepts behind the creation of an R package.

## Installation

```{r}
# development version from GitHub:
install.packages("devtools") 

# install "cointoss" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("stat133-sp19/hw-stat133-afung98/binomial")

# install "cointoss" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("stat133-sp19/hw-stat133-afung98/binomial", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(binomial)

#calculating combinations
bin_choose(trials = 5L, success = 2)

#calculating probability of successes, assuming that the probability of success is 0.5
bin_probability(success = 0:2, trials = 5L, prob = 0.5)

# binomial probability distribution
bin_distribution(trials = 5L, prob = 0.5)

#plotting probability histogram 
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5L, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis1)

# binomial cumulative distribution
bin_cumulative(trials = 5L, prob = 0.5)

# plotting binomial cumulative distribution
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5L, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis2)

#listing binomial variable and its attributes
bin_variable(5L, 0.3)

#showing all summary measures of the binomial variable
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10L, p = 0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1

#mean of the distribution
bin_mean(10L, 0.3)

#variance of the distribution
bin_variance(10L, 0.3)

#mode of the distribution
bin_mode(10L, 0.3)

#skewness of the distribution
bin_skewness(10L, 0.3)

#tailedness of the distribution via the Kurtosis formula
bin_kurtosis(10L, 0.3)

```
