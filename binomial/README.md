## Overview
-------------------
`"binomial"` is an R package that implements functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

- `bin_choose()` calculates the number of combinations in which k successes can occur in n trials
- `bin_probability()` calculates the probability of a number of successes in some trials
- `bin_distribution()` creates data frame with the probabilities of successes within a number of trials
- `plot()` a method to barplot the object generated by `bin_distribution()`, or a line plot for the object created using `bin_cumulative()`
- `bin_cumulative()` creates a data frame showing successes, their probabilities, and cumulative probabilities
- `bin_variable()` lists the number of trials, probability, and attribute of the object
- `summary()` lists the summary measures (i.e. mean, variance, etc.) of a binomial variable from `bin_variable()`
- `bin_mean()` calculates expected value or mean of a binomial distribution
- `bin_variance()` calculates variance of a binomial distribution
- `bin_mode()` calculates mode of a binomial distribution
- `bin_skewness()` calculates the skewness of a binomial distribution
- `bin_kurtosis()` calculates tailedness of a binomial distribution; kurtosis formula

## Motivation
--------------------
This package has been developed to illustrate some of the concepts behind the creation of an R package.
