##**Workout 1: GSW Shot Charts**

####**Description**
This project draws from datasets of 5 players on the Golden State Warriors team: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Andre Iguodala, for the 2016-2017 NBA season. These individual datasets then become visualized using `ggplot2` after being manipulated using `dplyr` to get summaries of the players' effective shooting percentages. I have also incorporated shot charts for each of the player, using a simplistic outline of a basketball court as the background of these charts to hopefully give the readera clearer picture of where the shot attempts took place. Lastly, I wrote a brief report synthesizing and comparing some of the statistics that I have compiled to other NBA statistics to applaud the Golden State Warriors for their performance.
